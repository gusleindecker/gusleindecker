## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer focused on building fast, intuitive, and scalable user interfaces. With deep expertise in Vue.js, TypeScript, and modern web tech, I turn complex requirements into seamless, responsive experiences that users love.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve delivered high-performance web and mobile apps across industries, combining clean code with a strong eye for design. I enjoy bridging the gap between technical precision and user needs, always aiming for solutions that are both elegant and practical.

I'm also a lifelong learner, constantly exploring new tools, trends, and best practices to stay ahead in the ever-evolving frontend landscape.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Software Mind](https://softwaremind.com/)
